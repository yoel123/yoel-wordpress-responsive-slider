a simple responsive image slider

== Description ==

in my last project i searched for a responsive slider ,easy to edit,responsive and customizable css.

some were responsive but hard to edit,some was customizable but hard to edit,some was easy to edit but not realy rsponsive in bigger screens and the imegs didnt fit....

i was frustrated so i created a plugin that will fit my simple needs. and i believe others will find it usful too.
